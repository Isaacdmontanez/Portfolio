This website is a sample of some of my personal projects. 
These projects include a single-player Chess game, a graphing algorithm visualizer, and a sorting algorithm visualizer.
This website also includes a writing sample from when I was in law school.
This website was built using Javascript, React, and CSS without APIs, outside code, or help. It runs entirely on the client side.
To read about each project, please view the documentation on the website or in src\components\text.
